In the 1st program  we use  Workload Generation (Poisson Dist.) to figure out the actual number of arrivals which will give us an actual average of arrivals per second . First , through each iteration, we add up the value that is given by the Workload Generation (Poisson Dist.) into a variable. At the end of the for loop, we divide the  total amount of process by the variable that holds to the total arrive times to find out the actual number of arrivals per second.
